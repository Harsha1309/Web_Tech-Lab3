        <p>Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (/ˈɛlɪnɔːr ˈroʊzəvɛlt/; October 11, 1884 – November 7, 1962) was an American political figure, diplomat, and activist.[5] She served as the first lady of the United States from 1933 to 1945, during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office, making her the longest-serving first lady of the United States.[5] Roosevelt served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952.[6][7] President Harry S. Truman later called her the "First Lady of the World" in tribute to her human rights achievements.</p>

She relaxed the rule only once, on her return from her 1943 Pacific trip.[151] Because the Gridiron Club banned women from its annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists, Roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House, which she called . [152] She was interviewed by many newspapers; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever.[153] In the early days of her all-female press conferences, she said they would not address ,[154] since the role of the First Lady was expected to be non-political at that time. She also agreed at first that she would avoid discussing her views on pending congressional measures. Still, the press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with the first lady, access that had been unavailable in previous administrations";
